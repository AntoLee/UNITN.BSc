\section*{Problem}

A box contains $b$ white and $n$ black balls. A ball is drawn and replaced with $d+1$ of the same color, where $d$ is a positive integer. Compute the probability that the first drawn ball was black, given that the second draw was black.

\section*{Solution}

Let $\mathrm{black}$ and $\mathrm{white}$ denote the white and black ball drawn outcome respectively, then we have the probability space:

\[
\begin{array}{rl}
	\Omega&=\{\mathrm{black},\mathrm{white}\} \\
	\quad\cal{F}&=\cal{P}(\Omega) \\
\end{array}
\]

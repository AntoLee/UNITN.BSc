	\section*{Question 1}
	
	\noindent Hugo is trying to complete his card collection and needs just one last card. He can obtain cards from biscuit packs, and each pack has a $0.2$ probability of containing the card he needs. Hugo has enough money to buy at most $4$ packs, but he will stop buying as soon as he finds the missing card. Let $X$ be the number of packs Hugo buys.
